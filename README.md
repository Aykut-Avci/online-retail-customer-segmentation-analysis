# RFM-Based Customer Segmentation for a UK Online Retailer
## Project Description 

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the "Online Retail II" dataset. This dataset contains transactions from a UK-based online retailer, covering the period from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011. By performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, we identify distinct customer segments, which helps in developing targeted marketing strategies to boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction.
