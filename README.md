# RFM-Based Customer Segmentation for a UK Online Retailer

![Project Cover](data/project_cover.png)

## Project Description 

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the "Online Retail II" dataset. This dataset contains transactions from a UK-based online retailer, covering the period from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011. By performing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, we identify distinct customer segments, which helps in developing targeted marketing strategies to boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction.
 
This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and recommendations. Customer segments are labeled in the clean dataset and visualized using Tableau.
